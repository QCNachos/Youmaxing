YOUMAXING Monetization Brainstorm (Base app is free)
===================================================

North Star
---------
- Keep the core habit tracking + basic AI check-ins free.
- Monetize: (1) power features, (2) higher usage, (3) premium insights, (4) integrations, (5) accountability/coaching.

Definitions (so pricing stays coherent)
--------------------------------------
Free: onboarding + dashboard + basic tracking + limited AI + limited recommendations.
Paid: more AI, automation, integrations, advanced insights, personalization, and “outcomes”.

Web (Stripe) subscription options
--------------------------------
1) YOUMAXING Plus (individual)
   - Price ideas: $9.99–$14.99/mo or $79–$119/yr
   - Unlocks:
     - Higher AI message quota + longer memory window
     - Personalized weekly review + next-week plan
     - Advanced recommendations (prioritized, explain “why”, “what to do next”)
     - Custom routines/templates per aspect
     - Deep links + reminders + recurring tasks

2) YOUMAXING Pro (power user)
   - Price ideas: $19.99–$29.99/mo
   - Unlocks:
     - Multiple AI “modes” (coach / analyst / friend) + tone + provider choice
     - More integrations (calendar, health/fitness, finance export)
     - Trend-based insights + sources + “watchlists”
     - Goals dashboard: streaks, KPIs, progress projections

3) Family / Duo plan (2–5 people)
   - Price ideas: $24.99–$49.99/mo
   - Unlocks:
     - Shared events + reminders (birthdays, trips, family goals)
     - Optional “accountability” nudges between members
     - Shared shopping / meal planning / travel planning boards

App Store / Google Play monetization (IAP)
-----------------------------------------
Subscription SKU recommendations:
- Monthly + annual (always), optionally weekly for “trial-like” entry.
- Keep features aligned with web tiers; avoid fragmentation.

Suggested IAP tiers:
1) Plus (Mobile) – same as web Plus
2) Pro (Mobile) – same as web Pro

Notes:
- If you sell on web, follow platform rules: don’t mention “cheaper on web” inside the app copy.
- Use “Manage subscription” and neutral language.

Freemium upgrade triggers (what motivates purchase)
--------------------------------------------------
- AI quota reached → “Upgrade for unlimited coaching”
- Want weekly review / plan generation → paywall
- Want integrations (calendar sync, health, finance) → paywall
- Want “deep personalization” (tone/provider, memory, goal templates) → paywall
- Want accountability/coaching features → paywall

Add-ons (optional, keeps base cheap)
-----------------------------------
Consumable credits (web/app):
- “AI credits pack” (for extra messages, plan generations, or trend scans)
- Good when users are mostly free but occasionally want a big session.

One-time purchases:
- “30-day Youmaxing Challenge Pack” (templates + daily plan + prompts)
- “Goal System Packs” (e.g., Training cut/bulk plan, Finance budgeting system)

B2B / Partnerships (later)
-------------------------
- Corporate wellness: team plan + challenges + dashboards
- Gyms/coaches: coaching portal + client templates
- Influencer bundles: “creator pack” with custom routines and prompts

What should remain free (to feel generous)
------------------------------------------
- Basic tracking (manual)
- Basic reminders (limited)
- Basic AI chat (limited)
- Basic recommendations feed (limited)

What should be paid (high perceived value)
------------------------------------------
- Weekly review + plan generation
- Integrations & automation
- Higher AI usage + long-term “memory”
- Advanced analytics + projections
- Accountability features (nudges, check-ins, “coach mode”)

Experiment ideas (pricing + positioning)
----------------------------------------
- 7-day free trial of Plus (annual only)
- Intro offer: $0.99 first week / first month (careful with churn)
- Student pricing (requires verification)
- “Founders” annual pricing for early adopters

Next questions for you (so we can lock a plan)
----------------------------------------------
1) What is the single “must-have” premium feature we can sell first?
2) Do you want to monetize mainly via subscriptions, or mix subs + credits?
3) Target audience: students, young pros, fitness-focused, founders?
4) Expected AI cost per active user (roughly) so we set quotas correctly?
